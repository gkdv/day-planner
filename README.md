# day-planner

Day planner is a simple hour by hour planner from 9am to 5pm. You can add things to
do in each text box and click the save icon so your task will always be there until
you update them. If the hour has passed the content box will change from green to red 
to remind you the time has passed and hopefully you finished what you need to do.
